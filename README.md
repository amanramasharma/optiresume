**# Note on Git Collaboration:**__

Although Git was intended to be used throughout the development process, due to time constraints, communication preferences, and distributed task responsibilities, we collaboratively built and tested the project locally without continuous Git commits or merges.

We acknowledge this was not the best practice and will ensure proper Git collaboration in future coursework. This final push contains the combined efforts and working version of our project, developed and tested as a team.
